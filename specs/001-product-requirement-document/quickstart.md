**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Purpose**: Integration test scenarios and user workflow validation

## Prerequisites

### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm package manager
- Modern browser (Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+)

### User Environment (End User)
- Desktop or tablet with modern web browser
- Basic understanding of crochet terminology
- No installation required (web-based application)

## Quick Start Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create Basic Tote Bag Pattern (Happy Path)
**Test Purpose**: Validate complete user workflow from project creation to pattern export

**Steps**:
1. **Navigate to application**
   - Open web browser to application URL
   - Verify landing page loads within 3 seconds

2. **Create new project**
   - Click "New Project" button
   - Enter project name: "My First Tote"
   - Set dimensions: Width 40cm, Height 30cm
   - Click "Create Project"
   - **Expected**: Grid appears with 40x30 cells

3. **Place motifs on grid**
   - Browse motif library on left panel
   - Select "Rose" motif from flower category
   - Drag rose to center of grid (position ~20,15)
   - **Expected**: Rose motif appears on grid at specified position
   - Place second motif: "Bird" at position ~10,20
   - **Expected**: Both motifs visible without overlap

4. **Generate pattern**
   - Verify stitch interpretation toggle is set to "Black = Filled Stitch"
   - Click "Generate Pattern" button
   - **Expected**: Pattern chart appears showing filled/open squares
   - **Expected**: Yarn calculation shows number of skeins needed

5. **Export pattern**
   - Click "Export" button
   - Select "PDF" format
   - Click "Download"
   - **Expected**: PDF file downloads with pattern chart and instructions

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Project created in <2 seconds
- ✅ Grid renders smoothly for 40x30 (1200 cells)
- ✅ Motifs can be placed without overlap validation errors
- ✅ Pattern generates within 5 seconds
- ✅ PDF exports with readable chart and yarn calculations
- ✅ Total workflow completes in <3 minutes

### Scenario 2: Edge Case Testing (Boundary Validation)
**Test Purpose**: Validate system handles edge cases gracefully

**Steps**:
1. **Test minimum dimensions**
   - Create project with 20cm x 20cm dimensions
   - **Expected**: Grid creates successfully with 400 cells

2. **Test maximum dimensions**
   - Create project with 200cm x 200cm dimensions
   - **Expected**: Grid creates with performance warning but renders smoothly
   - **Expected**: Scrollbars appear for navigation

3. **Test motif boundary placement**
   - Select large motif (e.g., 10x10 cells)
   - Attempt to place at position (195, 195) on 200x200 grid
   - **Expected**: System prevents placement (would exceed boundaries)
   - **Expected**: Clear error message displayed

4. **Test overlapping motifs**
   - Place first motif at position (50, 50)
   - Attempt to place overlapping motif at position (52, 52)
   - **Expected**: System prevents overlap or provides clear warning
   - **Expected**: User can choose to replace or cancel

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Dimension validation prevents values outside 20-200 range
- ✅ Boundary checking prevents motif overflow
- ✅ Clear error messages for invalid operations
- ✅ Large grids (200x200) render with acceptable performance (<10 seconds)

### Scenario 3: Pattern Generation Variations
**Test Purpose**: Validate pattern interpretation toggle and different configurations

**Steps**:
1. **Create pattern with mixed motifs**
   - Create 50x50 project
   - Place 3 different motif types (flower, bird, letter)
   - Generate pattern with "Black = Filled Stitch"
   - **Expected**: Pattern shows motifs as filled squares

2. **Toggle stitch interpretation**
   - Change setting to "Black = Open Stitch"
   - Regenerate pattern
   - **Expected**: Same motifs now show as open squares
   - **Expected**: Yarn calculation updates accordingly

3. **Validate yarn calculations**
   - Count total filled cells manually for small pattern
   - Verify calculation: Total cells × 4cm = yarn length
   - Verify: Math.ceil(yarn length / 7500) = skeins needed
   - **Expected**: Manual calculation matches system calculation

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Pattern toggle works correctly and updates display
- ✅ Yarn calculations are mathematically accurate
- ✅ Pattern regeneration completes within 3 seconds
- ✅ Visual feedback clearly shows filled vs open stitches

### Scenario 4: Data Persistence
**Test Purpose**: Validate project saving and loading functionality

**Steps**:
1. **Auto-save functionality**
   - Create project and place motifs
   - Wait 30 seconds (auto-save interval)
   - Refresh browser page
   - **Expected**: Project loads with all motifs intact

2. **Manual save/load**
   - Make changes to project
   - Export as JSON format
   - Clear browser storage
   - Import JSON file
   - **Expected**: Project restores exactly as exported

3. **Project management**
   - Create multiple projects
   - Switch between projects
   - **Expected**: Each project maintains independent state
   - **Expected**: Project list shows all created projects

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Auto-save preserves work without user intervention
- ✅ JSON export/import maintains complete project fidelity
- ✅ Multiple projects can be managed independently
- ✅ Browser refresh doesn't lose unsaved work

## Performance Benchmarks
