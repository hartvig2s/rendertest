# Feature Specification: Crochet Tote Bag Design Tool MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-product-requirement-document`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Product Requirement Document (PRD)  Crochet Tote Bag Design Tool MVP"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a crochet enthusiast (Emma), I want to design custom tote bag patterns using filet crochet so that I can create original designs without manual calculations and share professional-looking patterns with others. I need to specify bag dimensions, place decorative motifs on a grid, and get accurate yarn calculations with exportable patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I want to create a new tote bag pattern, **When** I enter dimensions (width: 40cm, height: 30cm), **Then** the system generates a 40x30 grid where each square represents 1cm
2. **Given** I have a generated grid, **When** I drag a flower motif onto the grid, **Then** the motif appears on the grid and I can position it anywhere within the boundaries
3. **Given** I have placed motifs on my design, **When** I click "Generate Pattern", **Then** the system shows me a crochet chart with filled/open squares and calculates yarn requirements
4. **Given** I have a completed pattern, **When** I click "Export", **Then** I can download the pattern as PDF with grid chart and yarn calculations
5. **Given** I'm viewing my pattern, **When** I toggle the "Black = Filled Stitch" setting, **Then** the pattern interpretation switches between filled and open stitches for black squares

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user enters dimensions outside the 20-200cm range?
- How does system handle overlapping motifs on the grid?
- What occurs if user tries to export before generating a pattern?
- How does system behave when motifs extend beyond grid boundaries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to specify tote bag dimensions with width and height between 20cm and 200cm
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically generate a filet crochet grid where each square represents 1cm x 1cm
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide pre-defined motifs (flowers, birds, letters) that users can drag and drop onto the grid
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to position motifs anywhere within the grid boundaries
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate crochet patterns showing filled and open stitches based on black/white grid squares
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a toggle button to switch interpretation between "black = filled stitch" and "black = open stitch"
- **FR-007**: System MUST calculate yarn requirements using the formula: 1 stitch = 4cm of yarn, 1 skein = 75 meters
- **FR-008**: System MUST display the number of skeins needed for the complete pattern
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to export completed patterns in PDF format
- **FR-010**: System MUST include yarn calculations in the exported pattern
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent placement of motifs outside grid boundaries
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain pattern integrity when toggling between filled/open stitch interpretations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents a tote bag design with dimensions, grid layout, placed motifs, and generated pattern
- **Grid**: 2D array representing the design canvas with each cell corresponding to 1cm x 1cm
- **Motif**: Pre-defined decorative elements (flowers, birds, letters) that can be placed on the grid
- **Pattern**: Generated crochet instructions showing filled/open stitches based on grid design
- **Yarn Calculation**: Mathematical computation of material requirements based on pattern complexity
